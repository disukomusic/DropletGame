## Overview:
Droplet Dash is a 3D arcade game where players control a water droplet named Steve, navigating through the roots of a tree to collect water and deliver it to the trunk of the tree.

## How to Play:
The objective of Droplet Dash is to guide Steve, the water droplet, through the root system of the tree to collect as much water as possible and deliver it to the tree trunk before the time runs out. Players must overcome obstacles such as worms and poison mushrooms, and use power-ups to collect Droplets and give them to the Tree before the time runs out.
